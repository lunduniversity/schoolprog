# Python Cheatsheet 

## Variables and printing

```python
x = 10    # the variable x gets the value 10
print(x)  # prints 10
x = "hej" # x value is changed to "hej"
print(x)  # prints "hej"
```

## Kinds of variables
Strings, Integers, Floating Points

The kind of a variable is determined when a variable is assigned a value

```python
a = 1        # a is now an integer with the value 1
a = "1"      # a is now a string with the value "1"
a = int("1") # "1" is converted to the integer 1
a = str(1)   # 1 is converted to the string "1"
a = float(1) # 1 is converted to the float 1.0
a = 1/1      # 1/1 evaluates to the float 1.0
```

Note that ``` int("hej") ``` will crash on evaluation.
The ```int``` and ```float``` functions expects values that can be interpreted as numbers.

## Arithmetic

```python
x0 = 1 + 1  # x0 == 2
x1 = 1 - 1  # x1 == 0
x2 = 2 * 3  # x2 == 6
x3 = 3 / 2  # x3 == 1.5
x4 = 3 // 2 # x4 == 1, largest integer <= 3/2
x5 = 3 % 2  # x5 == 1, 3 mod 2 == 1
x6 = 2 ** 3 # x6 == 8, (2^3).
```
Lots of mathematical functions, like ```sin``` and ```sqrt``` are avaliable in the ```math``` package.
```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(4)) # prints 2
```

## Control flow

Do different things dependent on expression values:

```python
if a < 10:
    print("a is less than 10")
elif a == 10:
    print("a is equal to 10")
else:
    print("a is larger than 10")
```

## Iteration

Print the first 10 powers of 2:

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i**2)
```

Iterate over the first 10 natural numbers and print the odd ones:
```python
for i in range(10):
    if i%2 == 1:
        print(i)
```

## Input

Read a line of input and print the result:

```python
print("What is your name?")
name = input("Name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

Read a whole number from input:

```python
n = int(input())  # The number given by
for i in range(n):
    print(i * 2)
```


## Functions
'def' is a common keyword reserved in Python which indicates that the code
that follows is a function. Straight after 'def' comes the name of the function, usually typed with small
letters and "_" between words. Pick a self explanatory name for your own
sake, it will be easier to remember. Inside the paratnheses is where you can
put parameters, potential input for your function. The name for your parameters
should also be chosen with care. After the parantheses is a ";", this will
tell the compilater where the block of code starts for the function.
Indentation (the extra space before the code) will then tell the compilator
what is part of the function.


Check the following example:
Calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with two decimal numbers as input:

```python
base = float(input("Base: "))  # Can be a number with decimals (a "floating point number")
side = float(input("Side: "))
hypotenuse = sqrt(base**2 + side**2)
print("The hypotenuse is: " + str(hypotenuse))  # You must convert the number to a string before adding to another string
```

If we want to compute this many times in our code, we can define a function instead:

```python
from math import sqrt

def hypotenuse(base, side):
    return sqrt(base**2 + side**2)

print(hypotenuse(1, 1)) # prints 1.4142135623730951
print(hypotenuse(3, 4)) # prints 5.0
```

## Lists

Build a simple list:

```python
l = [1, 2, 3]
print(l)
```

Do something to each number in a list:

```python
l = [1, 2, 3]
for number in l:
    print(number * 2)
```

Build a list with the first `n` whole numbers and sum them together:

```python
n = 100
l = list(range(n))
print(sum(l))
```


## Debugging

Ensure that a statement is true, otherwise crash.

```python
assert True        # Will work fine
assert 3 * 2 == 6  # Will work fine
assert 1 + 1 == 3  # Will crash the program
```
